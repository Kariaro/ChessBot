# ChessBot
This chess engine is a small hobby project about integration with other tools and how to optimize complex systems.

# Current evaluation
The current evaluation system uses a combination of Alpha-Beta pruning and Quiescence search for captures.

I have not calculated the exact elo of the engine, but I would put it around `1500`
 elo.

# Playing against
The engine has a bot account on lichess but will not be active most of the time.
